if a+b = c then a + c = b and b+c = a

3 - 0 1 0         6 - 1 1 0
2 - 0 0 1         5 - 1 0 1
---------        -----------
3 - 0 1 1         3 - 0 1 1

so, if we shuffle the bit which is same in both numbers, the resulting xor wont change

in a permutation, the count of 0 in ith bit of all the integer <= the count of 1 in ith bit of all the integer
ex: 5    4    1    2    0    3
    101  100  001  010  000  011
0th index: 1 0 1 0 0 1
1st index: 0 0 0 1 0 1
2nd index: 1 1 0 0 0 0
