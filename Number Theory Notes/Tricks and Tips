### Finding the number of divisor of an integer n = (1 + p) x (1 + q) x (1 + r)
																								Here, p,q,r are the power of prime divisors.
				180 = 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 5
						= 2 ^ 2 x 3 ^ 2 x 5
		Number of divisors of 180 = (2+1) x (2+1) x (1+1)
															= 3 x 3 x 2
															= 18
